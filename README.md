# Valsequillo_FPV
This repository is for comparative techno-economic analysis of the Floating Photovoltaic (FPV) system versus the Land-mounted Photovoltaics (LPV). developed for Valsequillo Dam, Puebla, Mexico

Vlasequillo_TEA.py file provides Net Present Value (NPV), Internal Rate of Return (IRR), Discounted Payback Period (DPBP), and Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE) for:
A) Baseline scenario 
B) +/- 25% of sensitivity analysis
C) Monte Carlo Simulation 

The data used are obtained from the IRENA Report "Renewable Power Generation Costs in 2023" with ISBN: 978-92-9260-621-3
For the FPV system, shipping and float costs are obtained from "Floating Photovoltaic System Cost Benchmark: Q1 2021 Installations on Artificial Water Bodies" and inserted in the cost data for Utility Scale PV Plants 
Energy prices are obtained from SIM for the year 2023 on an hourly basis and USD/Wh from "https://www.cenace.gob.mx/Paginas/SIM/Reportes/PreEnerServConMTR.aspx"

For other locations, the PVGIS satellite must be modified based on the specific locations
